# Obval — Obsidian + Pywal Integration

## Hello, friends!

Like many of you, I’ve always wanted a seamless integration between Obsidian and Pywal. Up until now, this required downloading a script and running it manually. But with Obval, everything happens automatically!

Simply run the command `wal -i your_image.jpg`, and Obval will automatically create an `obsidian.css` file in the snippets folder, updating Obsidian’s colors to match your image.

This version isn’t fully finished yet, but it’s ready for use. I hope you’ll enjoy it!
